"[ &1x $1 (1)\n&2x $2 (2)\n&3x $3 (3)\n&4x $4 (4)\n&5x $5 (5)\n&6x $6 (6)\n\n\n  Today's dish is very, very special to me, as you all know, it's the first one, the one that started this entire series. So, let's pay great attention to it! \n First thing is first, you take $1 and stuck it up the Bob's asshole. Second step to this delikatess is controling his psychologic state by stealing his $2 and then teasing him into thinking something spicy might happen, while, IN FACT, you prepare the $3. Next up, we take up arms, using the $4 to whip his pee pee, while having some $5 up his ass! And then, ofcourse, we attack him with &6 $6."
